        <div class="check-materials">
            <h2>How to Check Shampoo Materials</h2>
            <p>When selecting a shampoo, it's essential to check the ingredients list to ensure it meets your hair care needs. Look for shampoos that contain natural and nourishing ingredients, such as coconut oil, argan oil, and vitamin E. Avoid shampoos that contain harsh chemicals like sulfates and parabens, as these can strip the hair of its natural oils and cause damage over time. Additionally, consider your specific hair type and concerns when choosing a shampoo formula.</p>
